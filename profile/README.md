## Motivation

Our motivation for creating Bluebird Swap is to provide investors with a new asset class that combines the benefits of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the flexibility of options trading. NFTs are unique digital assets that have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to represent ownership and provenance of digital content. However, the high cost of some NFTs may make them inaccessible to many investors.

Fractionalization of NFTs can help address this issue by allowing investors to purchase a fraction of an NFT. This allows investors to gain exposure to high-value NFTs without having to pay the full price. Fractionalization can also increase liquidity in the NFT market, making it easier for investors to buy and sell NFTs.

Options trading can further enhance the flexibility and potential returns for investors in fractionalized NFTs. Options contracts provide the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) at or before a specific date (the expiration date). This means investors can use options to hedge against price fluctuations or generate additional income from their fractionalized NFT holdings.

In summary, a product for options trading of fractionalized NFTs can provide investors with a new asset class that combines the benefits of NFTs and options trading. This can increase accessibility to high-value NFTs, increase liquidity in the NFT market, and provide investors with more flexibility in managing their investments.

### Premium Calculation

An option premium is the price of an option contract. It is thus the income received by the seller (writer) of an option contract.

Options are priced based on the Black-Scholes formula:

$$C(S_t, t) = S_tN(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$$

where:

- $C(S_t, t)$ is the price of a call option at time $t$ with strike price $K$ and expiry $T$ on an underlying asset with current price $S_t$.

- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate
- $N$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution
$d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_t/K) + (r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}$
$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T-t}$

Here, $\sigma$ is the volatility of the underlying asset.
